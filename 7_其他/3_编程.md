##  编程
###   面向过程
we need design the detail



###   面向对象
we can let object to do some things which we want
* class
some things have same charater
it is abstraction template
we must use class's funntion before class is instantiation
such as : desk, student, ...
* object 
specific member of class
it is specific
such as : xxxdesk, Lihua, ...
include
property(data)
behavior(method)
* instantiation(实例化)
make specific object by use abstract class

* charater
packaging(封装)
inherit(继承)
polymorphism(多态)
在继承的基础上，子类重写覆盖了父类的方法，也就是父类的一个方法，在子类中表现出不同的形式
