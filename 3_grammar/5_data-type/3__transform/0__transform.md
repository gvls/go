##  transform
When do operate on different `data type`, we **must** do transform.
GO willn't transform data type **automatic** :  transform must `显式转换`.
Object of transform is **value** of `variate` (`data type` of `variate` isn't changed).
```go
res := <type>(<value>)	// format is like function
```


###   which data type use
* between basic on array
* between `int...` and `fload...` 


###   case which needn't transform
`数字不管没有小数点` / `'字符'`, they can is  intXXX or floatXXX
