## 2 attention
* Source code : `*.go` 

* Case sensitive

* One line write one statement

* Don't need add `;` to end of statement (`go` will add automatic)
If write more than one statement in one line (not recommend), pre statement need add `;` 

* if write one statement in more than one line, end of all line need end of operator

* `{}` must appear together

* `{` must write in end of statement (not write next line)
