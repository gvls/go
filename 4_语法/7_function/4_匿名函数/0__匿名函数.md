## 2 `匿名函数` 
It like one `statement`
If we want to use only once, we can use it
It can be use more than once

### 3  use
#### 4   use in define in `function` 
This method can use `匿名函数` only once

* format 
like define `function`   but not write `function name` 
head of `function` : write `variate` to receive `return value` 
end of `function` : write `([<parameter>[, ...]>)` to use


#### 4   use by evaluation to `variate` in `function` 
This method can use `匿名函数` more than once

* format 
like define `function` 
`function name` : not write
head of `function` : write `variate` to receive value(`function`)


#### 4   use `globle variate` which be evaluation by `匿名函数` 
It use this `variate` like use `function`
